# Configuration for d1: embedding-to-feature (regression)
# Task: Predict SAE feature activation from embedding layer output
# Input: 2304-dim embeddings
# Output: Continuous feature activation value

# model_type: logistic  # Options: logistic, random_forest, svm

hyperparams:
  # For logistic regression
  # C: 1.0              # Inverse regularization strength (lower = more regularization)
  # max_iter: 1000      # Maximum iterations for convergence

  # For random forest (uncomment when switching to that model)
  # n_estimators: 100   # Number of trees
  # max_depth: 10       # Max depth of trees

  # For SVM (uncomment when switching to that model)
  # C: 1.0
  # kernel: rbf         # Options: linear, rbf, poly
  # gamma: scale

training:
  cv_folds: 5         # Number of cross-validation folds
